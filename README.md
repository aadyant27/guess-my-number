## Guess My Number

# --Rules

- Its a game that generates a random number from 1 to 20 and the user has to guess it.
- If the guessed number is less than the target number, 'Too low' message will appear
- If its greater than the target number then, 'Too High' will appear
- You win if you guess the target number successfully before all of user's chances expire.
- HighScore is adjusted after the user wins the game.

This is a rather simple project that implements 'LOGIC-BASED DOM MANIPULATION'.
